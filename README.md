🚀 CIVIX
A Digital Civic Engagement Platform

CIVIX is a web-based platform developed during the Infosys Internship Program, aimed at strengthening communication between citizens and authorities through a transparent and technology-driven approach.

🌟 Why CIVIX?

Many civic issues go unnoticed due to lack of proper reporting channels.
CIVIX solves this problem by providing a centralized digital system where citizens can report issues and authorities can track and manage them efficiently.
